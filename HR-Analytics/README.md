# HR-Analytics-PowerBI

This project is an end-to-end HR analytics dashboard built using Power BI. It showcases key metrics and insights on employee attrition, salary distribution, performance ratings, and overtime trends, designed to help HR teams make data-informed decisions.

## Dashboard Overview

### **Dashboard 1: Attrition**
Focuses on understanding employee attrition across key categories.

**Key Visuals:**
- Employee count, attrition count & rate, average age, salary, and tenure.
- Attrition breakdown by:
  - Education
  - Age group
  - Gender
  - Salary
  - Job role
  - Years at company
- Matrix showing satisfaction scores of employees who left by job role

**Insights:**
- High attrition among employees with 1–2 years at the company
- Younger and lower-paid employees tend to leave more
- Job roles like Research Scientist show higher dissatisfaction


### **Dashboard 2: Salary**
Explores salary distribution across key demographics and satisfaction levels.

**Key Visuals:**
- Current employee count
- Salary analysis by:
  - Gender
  - Age group
  - Job role
  - Education
  - Job satisfaction

**Insights:**
- Higher satisfaction often aligns with higher salaries
- Younger employees are more likely to earn lower salaries, which may reflect entry-level positions or shorter tenure.
- For job roles, majority of employees fall within the 'up to 5k' and '5k–10k' salary ranges, possibly indicating a predominance of entry-level or lower-wage positions
- Salary distribution is fairly similar across educational fields, however, this may raise questions about how educational specialization factors into pay decisions.


### **Dashboard 3: Performance**
Examines the relationship between compensation and performance.

**Key Visual:**
- Performance rating by salary

**Insights:**
- High-performance employees are predominantly concentrated in the lower salary bands, likely reflecting younger employees (1–2 years tenure) still proving themselves in their roles. As these employees gain more experience, they are expected to transition to higher salary bands, similar to older employees who already occupy those roles.


### **Dashboard 4: Overtime**
Analyzes the impact of overtime work on attrition and employee well-being.

**Key Visuals:**
- Overtime analysis by:
  - Performance
  - Job role
  - Salary

**Insights:**
- Overtime correlates with higher attrition, as a higher proportion of employees who left the company worked overtime.
- Lower paid employees are working more overtime hours
- Average performers are more likely to work overtime
