# Excel Analysis

Excel pivot tables are a powerful tool for analyzing and summarizing data. In this project, Excel was used to explore ride counts and average ride durations, providing insights into user behavior and trends.

## Example Pivot Table Setup

To analyze the data effectively, the following pivot table configuration was used:

- **Rows**: User Type (e.g., Subscriber, Casual)
- **Columns**: Month (e.g., January, February, etc.)
- **Values**: 
    - Count of Rides
    - Average Duration

This setup allows for a clear comparison of ride activity and duration trends across different user types and months.

## Insights Gained from Excel Analysis

Using Excel, the following insights were derived:
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identified peak months for ride activity and variations in ride durations.
- **User Behavior**: Compared ride patterns between subscribers and casual users.
- **Performance Metrics**: Highlighted areas where ride durations were unusually high or low, indicating potential operational inefficiencies or user preferences.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

- Use Excel charts (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) to visualize trends and make the data more accessible.
- Apply conditional formatting to highlight key metrics, such as months with the highest ride counts.
- Combine Excel analysis with other tools (e.g., SQL or R) for deeper insights and validation of findings.

By leveraging Excel's capabilities, this analysis provided a foundational understanding of the Cyclistic Bike Share data, supporting data-driven decision-making.
