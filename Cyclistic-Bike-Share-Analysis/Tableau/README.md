# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis: Tableau Dashboard

## Overview
The Tableau dashboard provides an interactive and visual exploration of the Cyclistic bike-share data. It enables users to analyze ride counts, durations, and user types, offering insights into trends and patterns in bike usage.

## Tableau Visualizations
The following visualizations were created to analyze the Cyclistic bike-share data:

1. **Ride Counts by User Type**  
    A bar chart showing the total number of rides for different user types (e.g., Customer, Subscriber).

2. **Average Duration by User Type**  
    A bar chart displaying the average ride duration for different user types.

3. **Monthly Ride Counts**  
    A line chart illustrating trends in ride counts over the months.

4. **Ride Distribution by Day of Week**  
    A bar chart analyzing how bike usage varies across different days of the week.

5. **Map Visualization (if applicable)**  
    A geographic map displaying areas with high usage of the bike-sharing service, based on latitude and longitude data.

### Dashboard Features
- **Filters**: Users can filter data by user type and month to explore specific subsets of the data.
- **Interactivity**: Clicking on visual elements (e.g., bars, lines) dynamically updates other visualizations for deeper insights.

## Steps to Create the Tableau Dashboard

### Step 1: Data Import
1. Import the cleaned dataset (CSV, Excel, or SQL connection) into Tableau:
    - Navigate to `File -> Open -> Select Data Source`.
2. Ensure the data is properly formatted and cleaned for analysis.

### Step 2: Creating Visualizations
#### Ride Counts by User Type
- Drag `user_type` to Rows.
- Drag `ride_id` (or another unique identifier) to Columns and set the aggregation to `Count`.
- Use a bar chart to represent total ride counts for each user type.

#### Average Duration by User Type
- Drag `user_type` to Rows.
- Drag `duration` to Columns and set the aggregation to `Average`.
- Represent this with a bar chart showing average ride duration for each user type.

#### Monthly Ride Counts
- Drag `start_date` to Rows and set it to display months.
- Drag `ride_id` to Columns and set the aggregation to `Count`.
- Use a line chart to show trends in ride counts over the months.

#### Ride Distribution by Day of Week
- Drag `start_date` to Rows and set it to display the day of the week.
- Drag `ride_id` to Columns and set the aggregation to `Count`.
- Use a bar chart to display ride distribution across days of the week.

#### Map Visualization (if applicable)
- If geolocation data (latitude and longitude) is available:
  - Drag `latitude` and `longitude` to Rows and Columns.
  - Use `SUM(ride_count)` as the measure to visualize bike-sharing hotspots.

### Step 3: Create a Dashboard
1. Navigate to the "Dashboard" tab in Tableau.
2. Drag individual visualizations into the dashboard area.
3. Adjust the layout to fit the desired size and design.
4. Add filters (e.g., user type, month) to enable interactivity.
5. Configure actions to allow dynamic filtering between visualizations.

### Step 4: Exporting the Dashboard
- Export the dashboard for sharing or presentation:
  - **Image**: `File -> Export As Image -> Save`.
  - **PDF**: `File -> Export As PDF -> Choose export options`.

## Insights from the Analysis
The Tableau dashboard provides valuable insights into Cyclistic's bike-share program, including:
- **User Behavior**: Understanding differences in ride counts and durations between customers and subscribers.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identifying peak usage months and seasonal patterns.
- **Day-of-Week Preferences**: Analyzing how bike usage varies across weekdays and weekends.
- **Geographic Hotspots**: Locating areas with high bike usage to optimize station placement and resource allocation.

These insights can help Cyclistic improve its services, target marketing efforts, and enhance user satisfaction.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before importing into Tableau.
- Use descriptive titles and labels for all visualizations to improve readability.
- Regularly update the dashboard with new data to maintain relevance and accuracy.
